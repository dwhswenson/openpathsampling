Getting Help
============

Even if the best docs won't always answer your questions. If you can't
figure out how to do what you want, there are a few places you can ask,
depending on the nature of your question.

* **Usage questions:** "How do I do X with OPS?", "Is there a way to do Y?"
  "Why does this give an error?" Please ask at
  https://mattermodeling.stackexchange.com, using the ``openpathsampling``
  tag.
* **Bug reports:** "I got this error, and I'm sure it's a bug." Please post
  it, with a `minimal reproducible example
  <https://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2018/02/28/minimal-bug-reports>`_,
  in our `GitHub Issues
  <https://github.com/openpathsampling/openpathsampling/issues>`_.
* **Feature requests and implementation advice**: "I'd like this feature" or
  "I'm trying to add this feature, what's the best way?" These are also
  suitable for `GitHub Issues
  <https://github.com/openpathsampling/openpathsampling/issues>`_.
  Implementation advice is also one of the few cases where emailing the lead
  developer is a good idea.

There are two main motivations in asking you to follow these rules:

1. By posting in public, the answers to your questions are available to
   others. If you had a question, someone else might have the same question
   as well!
2. By posting in public, you can engage the broader community's help. If you
   aren't sure whether the problem you're having is with OPS or with Python,
   post it at https://mattermodeling.stackexchange.com and use both those
   tags -- you might get an answer from a Python expert there before the OPS
   team even has a chance to see your post!
