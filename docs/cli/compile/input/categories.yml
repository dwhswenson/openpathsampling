engine:
  header: Engines
  description: |
    Engines provide the interface to the external tools that actually
    perform the molecular dynamics. Usually you set up an engine using its
    native tools, and provide OPS with those configuration files.

    Engines can be made under the top-level keyword ``engines``.

cv:
  header: Collective Variables
  description: |
    Collective variables (CVs) are functions that map an MD snapshot to a
    number. They are typically used to define stable states and interface sets.

    CVs can be made under the top-level keyword ``cvs``.

volume:
  header: Volumes
  description: |
    State and interface definitions in OpenPathSampling are (hyper)volumes
    in phase space. Use these tools to define states and the substituent
    volumes that comprise them.

    Volumes can be made under the top-level keywords ``volumes`` or
    ``states``. The ``volumes`` keyword is parsed first, so ``states`` can
    depend on ``volumes`` but not vice versa.

network:
  header: Networks
  description: |
    Networks represent the collection of path ensembles to be sampled.

    Networks can be made under the top-level keyword ``networks``.

scheme:
  header: Move Schemes
  description: |
    Move schemes define the Monte Carlo moves to be used during path
    sampling. There is one move scheme per path sampling simulation; it may
    consist of multiple move strategies that create individual Monte Carlo
    moves.

    Some move schemes are designed to be used as-is, without allowing the
    user to mix in other move strategies. Others are designed to be extended
    by additional strategies.

    Move schemes can be made under the top-level keyword ``schemes``.


strategy:
  header: Move Strategies
  description: |
    Move strategies define the specific types of moves that are used in a
    move scheme, and set parameters on those moves.

shooting-point-selector:
  header: Shooting Point Selectors
  description: |
    Shooting point selectors determine how a a shooting move selects the
    shooting point. Custom versions are frequently used to focus the
    shooting effort in particular regions of phase space, such as near
    barriers or near interface boundaries.
