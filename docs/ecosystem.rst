The OPS Ecosystem
=================

One of the things we're most proud of about OpenPathSampling is that, by
developing in a library-based approach, we can have a powerful ecosystem of
plugins that users can use without requiring that they be in the core of
OpenPathSampling.

A number of such plugins have been developed. Some have since been
integrated into the core OPS library. For the packages that haven't been
integrated, we're happy to advertise their existence here. Note that we
can't guarantee support of these modules, nor have we reviewed their
correctness. But they may be useful tools for OPS users.

For developers of external contributions, we encourage you to submit PRs to
the OPS documentation to add your modules to this list.
